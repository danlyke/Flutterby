This is a set of libraries I wrote mostly over a decade ago, first as
a set of libraries written to support applications written by my
consulting company back in the late .com era, which was also the
foundation for the code which has supported the Flutterby.com weblog
content management system for years and years.

More recently, I added the Fby modules to support the static website
publishing of Flutterby.net.

I keep thinking I should integrate this stuff with CPAN, and then go
look and realize that this just works, and for the most part it's
evolved to a set of inputs and keeping security holes to a minimum,
and haven't bothered to revisit it.

There's a lot about the code that isn't modern Perl, I may get there,
or I may go on to other things.
